        Another case in point is the body of work of the <mark>Ranters</mark>, a radical group which flourished during the second half of the 17th century, with heretical views on religion (if Jesus is in everyone, who needs the Church?), politics (expropriation of the rich and collective ownership of property) and sex (preaching an ideal of free love). Such an extremist rebel group (which counted a few thousand followers in London alone) could easily self-publish and distribute its pamphlets. Though such publications were banned and burned, it was much more difficult to destroy an entire printed edition than had been the case with manuscripts, because of the sheer number of copies as well as their widespread distribution – and so some copies survived, a few even to this day.3

        Finally, the Fluxus movement was also the first to properly formu- late the seminal concept of the network. The ‘Eternal Network’ was a radical idea, enabling practices which would transform the working methods of many artists: an “ongoing, global artistic network in which each participating artist realizes that s/he is part of a wider network. It is a model of creative activity with no borders between artist and audience, with both working on a common creation.” <mark>(Chuck Welch, Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology).</mark>

        <mark>Another powerful concept (and one foreseen by Fluxus) to emerge during this period was the idea of a ‘network’ of magazines. In its cooperative form, this concept was brought into practice by the Underground Press Syndicate, a network of counterculture newspa- pers and magazines founded in 1967 by several early underground publishers. The common agreement was that any member of the net- work was allowed to reprint, free of charge, the contents of any other member, and that any publication could join the network later on, provided they agreed to the same terms. The result was a widespread distribution of countercultural articles, stories and comics, as well as a treasure trove of content immediately available to even the small- est startup publication. At the time it was founded, the Underground Press Syndicate brought together 62 of the approximately 150 publi- cations then considered as underground press.</mark>

        Another approach to photocopied publication was the one taken by a particular wing of the Autonomist political movement. The ‘Creative Autonomism’ movement, which flourished in Italy during the 1977 nationwide wave of university student sit-ins, generated almost a hun- dred different Dadaist and Surrealist-influenced political zines, featur- ing subversive (often bordering on illegal) content. Some of the most interesting products of this prolific underground scene were the vari- ous ‘fakes’, a specific sub-genre within underground publishing: clever parodies by creative individuals ‘hijacking’ established (large or small) publications by mimicking their graphic style and typeface. One of the most celebrated was the <mark><em>Il Male</em> series of campaigns, which featured outrageous yet somehow plausible journalistic ‘scoops’, designed to re- semble the front pages of major newspapers and displayed near news- stands, regularly triggering a wave of public anger, shock or disbelief.</mark>

        But in order to understand the impact of this fake print object as a conceptual and activist campaign, we must first understand how our current perception of the news is derived from this virtual news space which we navigate every day. We trust it – because it is printed, and because of the way it is printed. And so the fake <em>New York Times</em> is also a perfect illustration of the philosopher <mark>Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi’s state- ment on the cover of his 1977 A/Traverso zine: “false information that produces real events”.</mark>

            I soon realised that even in the ‘horizontal’ and egalitarian Internet culture of those early days, some nodes would always be ‘more equal’ than others; a collectively implemented process distinguishes important nodes from not-so-important ones, on the basis of their reputation. <mark>As Mathieu O’Neil pointed out in his book Cyberchiefs, the Internet may well be “a stateless system”, yet communities which have managed to produce outstanding results need to ensure quality control, which can only be done by establishing some form of authority.</mark> In such contexts, the distribution of authority becomes synonymous with what O’Neil calls “the distribution of charisma”293 – stripped (largely through the pioneering efforts of hacker groups) of the rigid hierarchies of more traditional meritocratic systems.
