        Yes, similarly arXiv.org is a very important online repository for physics schol- arship. One of the reasons scientists have been more active in promoting open access is, at least partly, because when you’ve done your interpretation of Henry James and it doesn’t come out for three years with a university press, nobody will die. But, if people are waiting for the results of your cancer research, it’s a rather different matter. There is also a different set of sensibilities, research funding agendas, and expectations in science, and there is a more explicitly articulated need for research to be shared. Many scientists are simply being pragmatic with this, yet they have become quite radical through their pragmatism. And, obviously a lot of people in the humanities have taken on this pragmatism— and its successes—and are really trying to challenge the hegemony of big pub- lishing corporations such as Elsevier or Springer in their search for alternative publishing models. Our interest with the Living Books project therefore lay in the politics of knowledge, but also in thinking across disciplinary boundaries. Personally, I’ve always been interested in biotechnology and bioethics. So, all of this science material I was reading and curating for my own living book on bioethics was useful to me intellectually, but I was also aware that involvement in the project allowed many humanities scholars to both consider science-related issues and reflect on the wider practices of knowledge production.

        The Living Books project was partly inspired by Gary Hall’s research into the idea of the book. With it, we wanted to challenge the notion of the book as a closed object, and to show that the book has always actually been open. Shakespeare’s First Folio, for example, contained several hundred different typefaces. <mark data-excerpter="cw">The book was therefore inherently unstable; it only became stabilized in a particular period of modernity, with the rise of liberal notions of copyright and authorship.</mark>

        Indeed, the aim of the Living Books experiment was to suggest that we need to focus on building horizontal alliances between different publishing institutions and different forms of publication. <mark data-excerpter="cw">So, with this project, we also wanted to explore how we can open up this whole idea of life as a problem not just for humanities scholars to think about, but also to live through. Many scholars are very good at analyzing and writing about life, but not necessarily at reflecting on their own scholarly practices. So we were asking, what would happen if you tried to do both?</mark>Living Books About Life was therefore about taking this double agenda on board, but at the same time it was also quite modest. Its aim was just to signal what was possible, and show that, perhaps, things could open up a little bit.

        The Photomediations Machine project deals and experiments with images, but also— via the planned editorship of Photomediations: An Open Book, which I’m working on with photographer and scholar Jonathan Shaw as part of the European Commission-funded Europeana Space project— with the form of the book. <mark data-excerpter="cw">As you know, early scholarly manuscripts were illuminated; they were also hand-copied and thus also contained a number of changes, corrections, substitutions, and individual marks. But, what has happened to academic manuscripts, especially in the last fifty or sixty years, is that they have become very unified, taking on the form of basic, black-print-on-white- page book blocks. Many scholars in the humanities don’t really care or even think about what their book looks like, only about what it says.</mark>So, with many of our projects under discussion we wanted to think about the book as an object, as a containment of ideas, but also to reintroduce a certain visuality to the humanities— which involves more than just sticking images in the appendix.

        In a way— again, this horizontal working together of different groups of people and materials is very instruc- tive— we’ve learned from scientists about open access and we can learn from others about other forms of organizing and doing things. We can learn about disruption from other agents and activists. <mark data-excerpter="cw">I’m aware that an engineer can probably live just fine without a philosopher while I probably couldn’t live without engineering in the daily, pragmatic sense of planning things, or using electricity, or my computer.</mark>

        Success is probably not a good criterion, because that would assume a linearity that’s not there in the production of a book. <mark data-excerpter="cw">It is more about trying to enact things differently, or maybe bring to the foreground this intrinsic instability of the book in some practices so as to allow others to see and put to the test that instability— while also not saying that we should all make all our books available online and read them as hypertext, because that would date this whole concept. I still like print and paper. Some of my preferences and affinities are historical; I come from a particular period and a certain gener- ation. I think we can allow for experimentation while also returning to the appreciation of a particular form—and of what it means at a particular moment in time.</mark>
