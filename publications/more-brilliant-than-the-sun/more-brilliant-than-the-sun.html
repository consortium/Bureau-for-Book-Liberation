  	  <h3>The Posthuman</h3>
      <p>
      Soul affirms the Human. Ra is disgusted with the Human. He desires to be alien, by emphasizing Egypt over Israel, the alien over human, the Future over the past. In his MythScience systems, Ancient Africans are alien Gods From a despotic Future. Sun Ra is the End of Soul, the replacement oF God by a Pharaonie Pantheon.
